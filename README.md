- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MortysTerminal
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in different types of coding and programming, specially automation. And I play video games in my free-time. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different types of programming and programming-languages for example Powershell, C# and Python - and of course I started to learn to use github.
